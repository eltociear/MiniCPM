MiniCPM is an End-Side LLM developed by ModelBest Inc. and TsinghuaNLP, with only 2.4B parameters excluding embeddings.

- MiniCPM has very close performance compared with Mistral-7B on open-sourced general benchmarks with better ability on Chinese, Mathematics and Coding after SFT. The overall performance exceeds Llama2-13B, MPT-30B, Falcon-40B, etc.
- After DPO, MiniCPM outperforms Llama2-70B-Chat, Vicuna-33B, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, Zephyr-7B-alpha, etc. on MTBench.
- MiniCPM-V, based on MiniCPM-2B, achieves the best overall performance among multimodel models of the same scale, surpassing existing multimodal large models built on Phi-2 and achieving performance comparable to or even better than 9.6B Qwen-VL-Chat on some tasks.
- MiniCPM can be deployed and infer on smartphones, and the speed of streaming output is relatively higher than human verbal speed. MiniCPM-V has also successfully deployed multi-modal models on smartphones.
- The cost of developing based on MiniCPM is low. Parameter efficient finetuning can be conducted with a single 1080/2080 GPU and full parameter finetuning can be conducted with a 3090/4090 GPU.

We release all model parameters for research and limited commercial use. In future, we will also release all the checkpoint during training and most public training data for research on model mechanism.

- SFT and DPO version based on MiniCPM-2B and human preference: **MiniCPM-2B-SFT/DPO**
- The multi-modal model **MiniCPM-V** based on MiniCPM-2B, which outperforms models with similar size, i.e., Phi-2
- The INT4 quantized version **MiniCPM-2B-SFT/DPO-Int4** based on MiniCPM-2B-SFT/DPO
- Mobile phone application based on MLC-LLM and LLMFarm. Both language model and multimodel model can conduct inference on smartphones.

### Limitations

- Due to limitations in model size, the model may experience hallucinatory issues. As DPO model tend to generate longer response, hallucinations are more likely to occur. We will also continue to iterate and improve the MiniCPM model.
- To ensure the generality of the model for academic research purposes, we have not subject it to any identity-specific training. Meanwhile, as we use ShareGPT open-source corpus as part of the training data, the model may output identity-related information similar to the GPT series models.
- Due to the limitation of model size, the output of the model is greatly influenced by prompts, which may result in inconsistent results from multiple attempts.
- Due to limited model capacity, the model's knowledge recall may not be accurate. In the future, we will combine the RAG method to enhance the model's knowledge retention ability.

## Quick Start

#### vLLM 

* Install vLLM supporting MiniCPM.
  - MiniCPM adopts the MUP program, which introduces some extra scaling operations to make the training process stable. And the MUP structure is a little different from the structure used by Llama and other LLMs.
  - vLLM 0.2.2 is adapted to MiniCPM in the folder [inference](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM/tree/main/inference). More vLLM versions will be supported in the future.

```shell
pip install inference/vllm
```

* Transfer Huggingface Transformers repo to vLLM-MiniCPM repo, where `<hf_repo_path>`, `<vllmcpm_repo_path>` are local paths.

```shell
python inference/convert_hf_to_vllmcpm.py --load <hf_repo_path> --save <vllmcpm_repo_path>
```

* Examples

```shell
cd inference/vllm/examples/infer_cpm
python inference.py --model_path <vllmcpm_repo_path> --prompt_path prompts/prompt_final.txt
```

#### Huggingface 

##### MiniCPM-2B

* Install `transformers>=4.36.0` and `accelerate`，run the following python code.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch
torch.manual_seed(0)

path = 'openbmb/MiniCPM-2B-dpo-bf16'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(path, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map='cuda', trust_remote_code=True)

responds, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "Which city is the capital of China?", temperature=0.8, top_p=0.8)
print(responds)
```

* Examples

```shell
The capital city of China is Beijing. Beijing is not only the political center of China but also a cultural and economic hub. It is known for its rich history and numerous landmarks, such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven. The city is also home to the National Stadium, also known as the "Bird's Nest," and the National Aquatics Center, or "Water Cube." Beijing is a significant city in China, with a population of over 21 million people.
```

##### MiniCPM-V

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V/', trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V', trust_remote_code=True)
model.eval().cuda()

image = Image.open('xx.jpg').convert('RGB')
question = 'What is in the image?'
msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]

res, context, _ = model.chat(
    image=image,
    msgs=msgs,
    context=None,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    sampling=True,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(res)
```

## Evaluation results

#### Evaluation Settings

* Since it is difficult to standardize the evaluation of LLMs and there is no public prompt and test code for a large number of evaluations, we can only try our best to make it suitable for all types of models in terms of specific evaluation methods.
* Overall, we use a unified prompt input for testing, and adjust the input according to the corresponding template for each model.
* **The evaluation scripts and prompts have been open-sourced in our Github repository, and we welcome more developers to continuously improve our evaluation methods.**
  * For the text evaluation part, we use our open source large model capability evaluation framework [UltraEval](https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval). The following is the open source model reproduction process:
    * install UltraEval
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval.git
      cd UltraEval
      pip install -e .
      ```
    * Download the relevant data and unzip it for processing
      ```shell
      wget -O RawData.zip "https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/71b5232264ae4833a4d0/?dl=1"
      unzip RawData.zip
      python data_process.py
      ```
    * Execute evaluation scripts (templates are provided and can be customized)
      ```shell
      bash run_eval.sh
      ```

#### Deployment mode

* Because MiniCPM uses the structure of Mup, which is slightly different from existing models in terms of specific computations, we have based the implementation of our model on the vllm=0.2.2 version.
* **For non-MiniCPM models, we directly sampled the latest version of vllm=0.2.7 for inference.**

#### Evaluation method

* For the QA task (multiple-choice task), we chose to test in two ways:
  * PPL: The options are used as a continuation of the question generation and the answer selection is based on the PPL of each option;
  * The second is to generate the answer options directly.
* For different models, the results obtained by these two approaches vary widely. the results on both MiniCPM models are closer, while models such as Mistral-7B-v0.1 perform better on PPL and worse on direct generation.
* In the specific evaluation, we take the higher score of the two evaluation methods as the final result, so as to ensure the fairness of the comparison (* in the following table indicates the PPL).

## Deployment on mobile phones

#### Tutorial

* After INT4 quantization, MiniCPM only occupies 2GB of space, meeting the requirements of inference on end devices. 
* We have made different adaptations for different operating systems.
* **Note: The current open-source framework is still improving its support for mobile phones, and not all chips and operating system versions can successfully run MLC-LLM or LLMFarm.**
* Android, Harmony OS
  * Adapt based on open-source framework MLC-LLM.
  * Adapted for text model MiniCPM, and multimodel model MiniCPM-V.
  * Support MiniCPM-2B-SFT-INT4、MiniCPM-2B-DPO-INT4、MiniCPM-V.
  * [Compile and Installation Guide](https://github.com/OpenBMB/mlc-MiniCPM/blob/main/README.md) 
* iOS
  * Adapt based on open-source framework LLMFarm.
  * Adapted for text model MiniCPM.
  * Support MiniCPM-2B-SFT-INT4、MiniCPM-2B-DPO-INT4.
  * [Compile and Installation Guide](https://github.com/OpenBMB/LLMFarm)

#### Performance

* We did not conduct in-depth optimization and system testing on the mobile inference model, only verifying the feasibility of MiniCPM using mobile phone chips for inference.
* There have been no previous attempts to deploy multimodal models on mobile phones. We have verified the feasibility of deploying MiniCPM-V on mobile phones based on MLC-LLM this time, and it can input and output normally. However, there also exist a problem of long image processing time, which needs further optimization :)
* **We welcome more developers to continuously improve the inference performance of LLMs on mobile phones and update the test results below.**

## Fine-tuning

* Parameter-efficient Tuning
  * With parameter-efficient tuning, we can tune MiniCPM using one piece of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080/2080.
  * [Code for Parameter-efficient Tuning](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM/tree/main/finetune)
  
* Full-parameter Tuning
  * Using [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain)，as well as checkpointing and ZeRO-3 (zero redundancy optimizer)，we can tune all parameters of MiniCPM using one piece of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090/4090.
  * This code will be available soon.
